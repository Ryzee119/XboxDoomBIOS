## DoomBIOS
* Play your Original Xbox the way Bill Gates truly intended with DoomBIOS.
* This is a 256kB bios image that replaces the OG Xbox BIOS to do one thing. Play DOOM.
* 100% opensource with no copyright code.

## Todo
* Fix conexant video encoder issues
* Fix fatx writes? Seems to work on xemu but not hw
* Test Xcalibur, Focus alot more
* Support locked Xbox hard drives

## Quickstart:
* You need to have your xbox harddrive in an unlocked state (FIXME!)
* Download the [Shareware version](https://github.com/Daivuk/PureDOOM/blob/master/doom1.wad).
* Place at `E:/doom/doom1.wad`.
* Flash bios to your modchip of choice and run.

## Compile (Ubuntu/WSL2)
```
sudo apt install git build-essential clang nasm cmake python3 python3-pip git
pip install objutils lz4 pyelftools
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ryzee119/XboxDoomBIOS.git
cd XboxDoomBIOS
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This creates a 256kB binary that you use as an Original Xbox BIOS image.

## General features
Although we run doom, there's alot of boilerplate to make this work. The following are features I think are neat

* Uses FreeRTOS kernel for multithreading support
* Custom ATA/ATAPI driver with full DMA support up to UDMA6 (auto negotiated speeds)
* Seemlessly read/write files on FAT16,FAT32,exFAT and FATX filesystems using standard c library calls (fopen etc)
* ISO9660 support for reading DVD roms
* USB Mass Storage support
* PCM audio driver from nxdk
* Compresses the bios at compile time, and decompresses to RAM at run time using LZ4 for significant ROM savings.
* Uses the visor exploit which runs on any xbox version
* Comprehensive C library included using picolibc.
